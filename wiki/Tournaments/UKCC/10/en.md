## Ruleset

### General

- This tournament is a 1v1 double-elimination British osu! tournament.
- To be able to participate, players must have a ![][flag_GB] United Kingdom or ![][flag_IE] Ireland flag, otherwise the player must be able to provide proof of residency to the hosts.
- Matches will be Head To Head, with ScoreV2 as the scoring system used.
- Hosts, mappool selectors and referees are not permitted participate in the tournament.
- All players are to treat staff and other participants with a high level of respect. Any kind of mistreatment on the discord server or during matches (this includes homophobia, racism and toxicity) will result in a ban and will be blacklisted from participating from future UKCC tournaments.
- Where rules do not prevail, common sense shall. The administration has explicit discretion to apply their judgement on this as they see fit.
- Players are required to join the public discord so that they are contactable by other teams and staff. If a player can’t be contacted or is not responding to messages, through discord, ingame messages or forum pms, contact the staff.
- Mappools are to be released the Monday before a stage is due to happen.

### Reschedules

- Schedules for the next round are released on the Monday before a stage is due to happen and ALL matches will be scheduled for the weekend. You can reschedule for weekdays at the staff’s discretion.
- In order to reschedule, you must contact your opponents, agree on a time and be able to provide proof (by form of a screenshot/image) of the agreed reschedule to the Hosts.
- In effort to ensure as many matches take place as possible, reschedules are allowed up to 2 hours before your match is due to be played. However, your opponent holds the right to refuse a reschedule if asked less than 12 hours from the scheduled time
- If it is impossible to find a time to reschedule to that suits both players, players should talk to the Hosts (Yazzehh, Damarsh or oralekin) and they will attempt to sort something out.
- Matches that are uncertain to happen (for example, losers’ bracket matches) will still appear on the schedule. They are to be rescheduled if needed in the same way as confirmed matches.
- If a match needs rescheduling to a time after a related losers’ bracket match, the matches relying on the outcome of the rescheduled match will be rescheduled by staff and 24 hours will be given for rescheduling them, if needed.

### Match rules

- Referees will create the lobby approximately 10 minutes before the match is due to start. (UKCC: (Player 1) vs (Player 2))
- Players have a 10 minute grace period after their scheduled match time to join the lobby. If a player fails to join the lobby in this time, then the default win will go to the other player. If both players do not show up, both players will receive losses.
- We take no-shows seriously, if you fail to show up to your match without valid reason, you may forfeit your right to future UKCC tournaments.
- The referee cannot play during the match.

#### Qualifiers

- Players will play 9 maps (3 NoMod, 2 Hidden, 2 HardRock, 2 DoubleTime) once.
- The top 32/64 scores (depending on signups/screening) from qualifiers will make it through to the bracket stage.

#### Rolling

- When both players are in the lobby and ready, the referee will ask the players to !roll. The order of picks of bans is decided using the [UKCC Roll System](https://i.imgur.com/S0VIvni.png).

#### Banning

- Players have 2 minutes to ban a map. Failure to ban a map within this time limit results in a lost ban.
- For the Round of 64 to Round of 32, there will be one ban per player.
- From the Quarterfinals onwards, there will be two bans per player.
- There are no restrictions on bans and picks. Players are free to ban/pick any map regardless of mod.

#### Warm-ups

- Warm-up maps must be a submitted beatmap, and have a drain time of 4 minutes or less.

#### Picking

- Players have 90 seconds to pick a map. Failure to pick a map within this time limit results in pick choice being passed to the opposing team.
- Failed scores will count.
- Tiebreakers are FreeMod, however NoMod can be used.
